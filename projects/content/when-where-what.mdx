# What is When Where What?

When Where What is a web app that allows you to share a single link to users and support all calendars. It is a simple
and easy to use web app that allows you to create events and share them with your friends and family. It supports all
major calendars like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook Calendar, etc.

# How does this work?

Wh3 generates a simple link to your event, and you can share it with your friends and family. When they click on the link, a list of all the calendars supported by Wh3 will be shown. They can select any of the calendars and the event will be added to their calendar.

# My contribution to Wh3

## Frontend
 - We have used **NextJS**, a powerful JavaScript framework for server-rendered applications, and **TailwindCSS** for styling the frontend of our website. The combination of these technologies has allowed us to efficiently create and maintain a **visually appealing and user-friendly website.**
 - We have created a **custom theme** for our website using TailwindCSS. This theme is used throughout the website and allows us to maintain a consistent look and feel across the website.
 - I have implemented automated end-to-end tests using **Cypress** in order to ensure the quality and reliability of the front-end of our app. This powerful testing tool allows me to simulate user actions and verify that the app is functioning as intended, ultimately improving the user experience.

## Backend
 - We have chosen to use **MongoDB** as the database for our app. This NoSQL database is designed for scalability and flexibility, making it well-suited for modern application development.
 - I have written the backend API for our app using **NextJS functions**, which utilize **AWS Lambda** to run serverless code. This approach allows us to efficiently build and scale the API while taking advantage of the cost and performance benefits of **serverless computing**.
 - I have written unit tests for our app using **MochaJS** and **chaiJS**. These testing libraries allow me to simulate user actions and verify that the app is functioning as intended, ultimately improving the user experience.
